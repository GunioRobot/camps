<h1>Welcome to DevCamps.org</h1>

<p>DevCamps are a software system and conventions for making automated development and staging environments called "camps".</p>

<p>Focused on web applications, camps make it easy to keep development environments up to date, use version control (including in production if desired), and coordinate multiple simultaneous projects and developers.</p>

<p>DevCamps were developed at <a href="http://www.endpoint.com"><img src="http://www.endpoint.com/images/end_point.png" alt="End Point" /></a> and are in extensive use on several dozen sites. Camps adapt well to various workflows.</p>
